# This program outputs a computer program equivalent to 1.py
#
# The Intuitive Ordinal Notations (IONs) are defined so that:
#   "For any computer program P, if all the outputs of P are
#   IONs, then P itself is an ION."
#
# This program only has one output, and that output is an ION.
# Therefore, this program is also an ION.
# It notates the ordinal 1.
