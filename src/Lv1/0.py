# This program does nothing.
#
# The Intuitive Ordinal Notations (IONs) are defined so that:
#   "For any computer program P, if all the outputs of P are
#   IONs, then P itself is an ION."
#
# This program outputs nothing. Therefore, vacuously, all of
# its outputs are IONs. Therefore, this program is an ION. It
# notates the smallest computable ordinal, 0.
