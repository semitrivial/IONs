The Computable Ordinal Notation Sutra

In [1], we presented an intuitive ordinal notation system and
argued that the task of notating computable ordinals is a
task that gets directly at the heart of what it means to be
intelligent. The purpose of this library is to present some
low-level examples of ordinal notations. Currently, the
largest example in the library is ω^ω.

This library is designed with the motto: "Show your work." By
the nature of our intuitive ordinal notation system, we could
simply exhibit our notation for ω^ω, which notation is, itself,
a computer program which could be used to programmatically
obtain notations for all ordinals below ω^ω. But if we simply
exhibited the notation for ω^ω, it would be mystifying how that
notation was obtained. Instead, this Sutra is organized in such
a way that the reader can follow along in the construction of
each notation.
