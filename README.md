The Computable Ordinal Notation Sutra

In [1], we presented an intuitive ordinal notation system and
argued that the task of notating computable ordinals is a
task that gets directly at the heart of what it means to be
intelligent. This library contains some
examples of ordinal notations. Currently, the
largest example in the library is ω^ω.

Think of this library as a meditation on automated code generation.
The ordinal notations in this library are themselves computer
programs which output ordinal notations (except for 0.py, which
outputs nothing). The notation for ω^ω is a computer program which
could, by its lonesome, be used to programmatically reproduce
computer programs equivalent to all the lesser ordinal notations
in the library.
