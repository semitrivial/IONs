## 3.py
# This program outputs a computer program equivalent to 2.py
#
# The Intuitive Ordinal Notations (IONs) are defined so that:
#   "For any computer program P, if all the outputs of P are
#   IONs, then P itself is an ION."
#
# This program only has one output, and that output is an ION.
# Therefore, this program is also an ION.
# It notates the ordinal 3.
#
# Examining 0.py, 1.py, 2.py, and 3.py, let us use our skills
# of pattern-matching, creativity, and the ability to generalize
# and extrapolate---in short: our intelligence---to write a
# single program that captures the pattern.
