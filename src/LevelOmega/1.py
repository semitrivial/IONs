# Welcome to Level 5. Our goal in this level is to notate ω^ω.
# We start by rewriting some of the notations from earlier levels
# in alternate forms to make patterns more clear. The below is
# equivalent to just output(""), but we put it in this form so
# that we can systematically manipulate it (changing the initial
# value of X0).
